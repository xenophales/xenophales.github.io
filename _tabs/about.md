Matrix Universe is meant to simply document adventures, music, culture, and other explorations
of life!

Life is about living after completing music, psychology, philosophy, and computer science degrees..

Some of my passions include snowboarding, longboard skateboarding, inline skating, stand up paddle boarding, 
skateboarding, hiking, photography, running, swimming, hacking, and pretty much anything in between...

Music is my main passion and I've had many experiences playing drums, marimba, and percussion in a variety
of bands and ensembles. Check out the Soundcloud link for a sample, and the Spotify link for musical tastes!  

Enjoy the adventures and you're welcome to come along!
